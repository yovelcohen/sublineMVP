            - Gender-Specific Language Adaptation: First, attempt to find an equivalent translation that doesn't use a specific gender, if not found. translate while adjusting the translation to reflect the gender of each speaker appropriately. Alter verbs, adjectives, and certain nouns to suit the gender as per Hebrew linguistic rules.
            - Correct Grammatical Person - notice each row's speaker, if they use "I am.."/"You are"/"We are" etc, make sure to translate it to the correct grammatical person in Hebrew.

            Nice Work, you have completed the translations. Now, let's revise them for grammar and punctuation. 
            Review the translations you generated based on the following rules and return a valid JSON object with the revised translations in the same format as earlier. 
            Rules:
            -- Noun derivation
            In the same way that Hebrew verbs are conjugated by applying various prefixes, suffixes and internal vowel combinations, Hebrew nouns can be formed by applying various "meters" (Hebrew /miʃkaˈlim/) and suffixes to the same roots. Gerunds, as indicated above, are one example.

            - Many abstract nouns are derived from noun, using the suffix /-ut/:
            סֵפֶר /ˈsefer/ (book) → סִפְרוּת /sifˈrut/ (literature)
            Also, there is הִתְקַטְּלוּת /hitkat'lut/ meter, that also ends with /-ut/:     

            הִתְיַעֵץ /hitjaˈʕet͡s/ (to consult) → הִתְיַעֲצוּת /hitjaʕaˈt͡sut/ (consultation)
            הִתְרַגֵּשׁ /hitraˈɡeʃ/ (to get excited) → הִתְרַגְּשׁוּת /hitraɡˈʃut/ (excitement)
            
            The קַטְלָן /katˈlan/ meter applied to a root, and the /-an/ suffix applied to a noun, indicate an agent or job: 

            - Though occasionally this same suffix can denote an augmentative: 
            חֲנָיָה /ħanaˈja/ (parking space) → חַנְיוֹן /ħanˈjon/ (parking lot)
            קֶרַח /ˈkeraħ/ (ice) → קַרְחוֹן /karˈħon/ (glacier)


            - Some nouns use a combination of methods of derivation: 
            תּוֹעֶלֶת /toˈʕelet/ (benefit) → תוֹעַלְתָּנוּת /toʕaltaˈnut/ (Utilitarianism) (suffix /-an/ followed by suffix /-ut/)
            קֹמֶץ /ˈkomet͡s/ (handful) → קַמְצָן /kamˈt͡san/ (miser, miserly) → קַמְצָנוּת /qamt͡sanˈut/ (miserliness) (suffix /-an/ followed by suffix /-ut/)

            Noun construct: 
            In Hebrew, as in English, a noun can modify another noun. This is achieved by placing the modifier immediately after what it modifies, in a construction called סְמִיכוּת /smiˈχut/ (adjacency). The noun being modified appears in its construct form, or status constructus. For most nouns, the construct form is derived fairly easily from the normal (indefinite) form: 

            The singular of a masculine noun typically does not change form. 
            The plural of a masculine noun typically replaces the suffix ים- /-im/ with the suffix י- /-e/. 
            The singular of a feminine noun ending in ה- /-a/ typically replaces that ה with a ת /-at/. 
            The plural of a feminine noun typically does not change form. 
            There are many words (usually ancient ones) that have changes in vocalization in the construct form. For example, the construct form of /ˈbajit/ (house, בַּיִת) is /bet/ (house-of, בֵּית). However, these two forms are written the same without niqqudot.  n

            In addition, the definite article is never placed on the first noun (the one in the construct form). 

            בֵּית סֵפֶר /bet ˈsefer/ (literally, house-of book or bookhouse, i.e. school)
            בֵּית הַסֵּפֶר /bet ha-ˈsefer/ (literally, house-of the-book, i.e. the school)
            בָּתֵּי חוֹלִים /baˈte ħoˈlim/ (literally, houses-of sick-people, i.e. hospitals)
            עוּגַת הַשּׁוֹקוֹלָד /ʕuɡat ha-ʃokolad/ (the chocolate cake)
            דֹּואַר אֲוִיר /ˈdoʔar ʔaˈvir/ (air mail)
            כֶּלֶב רְחוֹב /ˈkelev reˈħov/ (street dog)
            בַּקְבּוּק הֶחָלָב /bakˈbuk he-ħaˈlav/ (the bottle of milk)
            However, this rule is not always adhered to in informal or colloquial speech; one finds, for example, הָעוֹרֵךְ דִּין /ha-ˈoʁeχ din/ (literally the law organiser, i.e. lawyer).

            You have done great so far, here's the final and most important step of the translation.
            Since you hadn't seen the series for yourself, just the english subtitles, you're not sure which row is spoken by which gender 
            and what's the gender of the recipient in the dialog. I'm gonna give you a map, from row index to it's speaker's gender.
            Please make sure that if the original sentences has needs of a certain grammatical person in hebrew, you suggest both male and female variations  of the sentence.  
            Make sure to return the same response structure as before.
            Row Index To Gender: {"1": "Male", "2":"Female", "3": "Female", "4": "Male"}
